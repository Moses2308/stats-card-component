## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This lesson mostly served to reinforce what I've previously learned. It retouched on the picture element and made use of media queries. Since I havent used them in too many projects, It was helpful for refreshing my memory of them.

### Continued development

I would like to continue practicing Semantic html and expanding my experience with more semantic elements.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This recource is my go to whenever I need to learn about things more in detail. I'm always referencing it to teach myself about new elements properties, or functions.
